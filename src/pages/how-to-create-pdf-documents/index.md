> Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF) files have almost become the standard for preparing well-formatted documents. There are PDF readers/displayers for most web browsers, so there is no real excuse for not providing this kind of formatted document to your users if your web application demands its use. Standardized forms and statistical reports can all be drawn from a web system’s data, so it makes sense to format that data in a common layout. [Adam Flaherty](http://people.oreilly.com/adfm)

Example uses for dynamically generated PDFs include orders, receipts, invoices, packing slips, event tickets, reports, certificates, booking details and anything else that would benefit from a well supported printable document format that can easily be sent to others and stored for archival purposes.

I created (and continue to develop) [Docca](https://docca.io) as a web service to ease the pain of implementing dynamic PDF files from your web site or service. Docca uses bespoke layout and PDF engines to generate documents from XML based document source generated by combining JSON data and applicable templates.

In researching the challenges inherent in PDF generation and the solutions available I gathered together some related articles and the libraries they use. I hope this might help you to get up to speed quickly and find the best solution for your situation.
